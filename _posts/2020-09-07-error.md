## Problem Description

When trying to install packages on Ubuntu 20.04 using apt, I got into the error as follows:

```python
$ sudo apt-get install -f nodejs npm

Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 nodejs : Conflicts: npm
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```





## Reason and Solution

This turned out to be the problem of changing the default `/etc/apt/source.list`. (often for download speed consideration). 

- Note that the edited **source needs to match with your Ubuntu version.** You can just baidu "Ubuntu 20.04 換源". Or use `lsb_release -a` to see the current version Codename, then find corresponding source on ali or tsinghua archive website. 

- Change the source corresponding to the Codename.
- `sudo apt update`
- That's it!  You can now install packages successfully!
